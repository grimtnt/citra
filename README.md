Citra
==============
[![AppVeyor CI Build Status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/k213m9mio0bhwo6a?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/valentinvanelslande/citra)

Citra is an open-source Nintendo 3DS emulator written in C++. It is written with portability in mind, with builds for Windows.

Citra emulates a subset of 3DS hardware and therefore is useful for running/debugging homebrew applications, and it is also able to run many commercial games! Some of these do not run at a playable state, but we are working every day to advance the project forward.

Citra is licensed under the GPLv2 (or any later version). Refer to the license.txt file included.
